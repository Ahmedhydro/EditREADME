# Satelite Image Processing for Flood Plain Areas
  This code has meant to automate the process of illustrating flood affected areas in past flooding events using Sentinel 2 images.
  This tool can help to evaluate what areas are prone to flood and how are those areas classified
## Goals:
* This Project aims to calculate flood extent using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).
* and then categorize the inondated areas utilizing Building Index, Vegetation Index and Bare Index (NDBI; NDVI and BSI) respectively.
